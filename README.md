# LobbyLifeguard

A lifeguard for your lobby that bans icky people on sight.

This mod is intended to stop unwelcome people that grief WEBFISHING lobbies by guessing lobby codes. It will automatically ban anyone configured in the banlist upon joining the lobby.

## Installation

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Vildravn/LobbyLifeguard/releases/latest/download/LobbyLifeguard.zip) and extract it to your game install.

You can also [install from Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/Vildravn/LobbyLifeguard/).

## Usage

Open LobbyLifeguard's settings by clicking on the Configure button in its entry in the Mods list.

The banlist field accepts a comma separated list of Steam IDs.

The banlist will update immediately upon saving changes, no game restart needed.

## Planned features

The following features are not yet implemented but I am planning to add them:

* Automatically add a person to the banlist when banned through the player list in-game
